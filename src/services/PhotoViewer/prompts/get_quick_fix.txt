Add the following fixes to this function:

// We need to import React and some components from React Native in order to 
// create our PhotoViewer component.
import React from 'react';
import { Image, View } from 'react-native';

// The PhotoViewer function should be a function component. It takes one argument: an object 
// with properties `imgURI` and `backgroundColor`.
// `imgURI` is the URL of the image we want to display, and `backgroundColor` is the color of the 
// background of the component.
export function PhotoViewer({ imgURI, backgroundColor }) {
  // The component that we returned is a View with a single Image inside of it.
  // The View component is a simple container for other components, and we can specify its style 
  // (including its background color) with the `style` prop.
  return (
    <View style={{ backgroundColor, flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
      {/* The Image component displays an image, which can be specified with the `source` prop. */}
      {/* We use uri inside source because we are loading image from a remote url */}
      <Image
        source={{uri: imgURI}}  
        style={{ width: "100%", height: "100%" }} // Image will take full width and height possible, adjust this as needed
      />
    </View>
  );
}
