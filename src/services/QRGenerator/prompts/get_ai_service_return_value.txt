Return a QR code generator component in React Native.

This component takes up all the space available (flex baby !)

This component has 2 Floating action buttons in the bottom right corner

A create button that creates a brand new QR code and displays it on screen. 
Center this QR code so it's displayed at the center of the component.

A download button that displays this qr code in the browser, using Linking.openUrl.
The reason for this button's existence is because the generated QR codes are probably created in the app folder, 
and opening it in a browser tab allows the user to save this app file in their respective download folder.
