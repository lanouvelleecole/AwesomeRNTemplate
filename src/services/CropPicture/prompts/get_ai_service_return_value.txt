A react Native component that gives the user a photo cropping UI, via a drag-and-drop crop square.
There's a crop button that crops the picture (imgPath), where the crop square is located within that picture,
and returns the path of the cropped piece. this also runs the onSuccess callback with that same cropped piece path as argument.
If something's wrong, return null, and run onError with the error as argument.
