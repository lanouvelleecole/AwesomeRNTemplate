Returns a list of strings containing all the user variables found in the source code. 
Return null if no user variable was found, or if an error took place during search.
The user variables are looking like this, with double brackets around them: {{VARIABLE_NAME}} , 
and I want a list of ["VARIABLE_NAME_1", "VARIABLE_NAME_2", ....] , without double brackets
